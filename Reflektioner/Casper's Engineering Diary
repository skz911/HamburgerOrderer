Day 1 - 2024-09-05

We created our repo (repositry) on GitHub, and created a working space on Trello
I have learned to commit on GitHub, which means adding a file or change of your own to a larger repo. I created a list of things to have on a burger, which I then committed.
We have also learnt to use merge, where two or more people make changes in the same file at the same time, and these changes then merge.
It took some time for us to get everything started (GitHub, Trello) but it works now.

Next time we will start designing and decide how to go about doing the project.
