Day 1 - 24/09/05

Today we started setting up our project. We figured out which environments we will use, which are listed in the Planning folder on GitHub.
We created a GitHub repository, a Trello board, Slack, and made sure we all have VS Code downloaded.

Then we also started working on our menu for the restaurant (Sides, Drinks, Burgers).

Today, we didn’t encounter any major issues, and everything went pretty smoothly! It only took a little time to set up all the environments and invite each other.

Git commands today: Commit and Merge.
Commit is when you update a file, and merge is when you have a branch that you want to commit into another branch. You resolve any conflicts if they arise.

Next time, we will continue reviewing our plan regarding drinks and sides, etc.
When we feel finished with that, we’ll move on to submission task 2 (item 4).

Day 2 - 24/09/06

Today, I created all the folders for our project, where we will have our kitchenView and our BurgerOrderer View.
I also created a place for our server code. For all these, I downloaded libraries and frameworks, as well as set up Docker files for everything.

The libraries and frameworks we chose to use are React with Babel and Nginx.

This was very difficult since I hadn’t done it before, but I finally managed to get our containers running, so you can see a "Hello World" message in them.

I got help from ChatGPT because Docker is a well-documented tool, and many people use it, which makes ChatGPT super helpful for solving problems!

Day 3 - 24/09/11

Today, I realized I hadn’t added a .gitignore to our files, which caused a lot of unnecessary data to be sent to our repository.
So, I started deleting the files that shouldn’t be there, and while I was working, the computer shut down due to low battery.
I finished the changes the day after.

Day 4 - 24/09/12

As mentioned on "Day 3," I completed the .gitignore.

Day 5 - 24/09/24

Today, I spent my time in Figma. Figma is a design program that can be used to design websites, for example.
I’ve used Figma before, so it didn’t take long to get back into it.

I created a landing page for the frontend, "Burger Orderer," as well as an "Order Page" where you can build your burger.

Today, I didn’t feel like there were any issues, and everything went pretty smoothly!

Tomorrow, the plan is to continue with Figma and also create views for smaller devices like mobile phones and iPads.
