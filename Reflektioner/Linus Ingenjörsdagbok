Day 1 - 24/09/05 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today we started setting up our project. We figured out which environments we will use, which are listed in the Planning folder on GitHub.
We created a GitHub repository, a Trello board, Slack, and made sure we all have VS Code downloaded.

Then we also started working on our menu for the restaurant (Sides, Drinks, Burgers).

Today, we didn’t encounter any major issues, and everything went pretty smoothly! It only took a little time to set up all the environments and invite each other.

Git commands today: Commit and Merge.
Commit is when you update a file, and merge is when you have a branch that you want to commit into another branch. You resolve any conflicts if they arise.

Next time, we will continue reviewing our plan regarding drinks and sides, etc.
When we feel finished with that, we’ll move on to submission task 2 (item 4).

Day 2 - 24/09/06 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, I created all the folders for our project, where we will have our kitchenView and our BurgerOrderer View.
I also created a place for our server code. For all these, I downloaded libraries and frameworks, as well as set up Docker files for everything.

The libraries and frameworks we chose to use are React with Babel and Nginx.

This was very difficult since I hadn’t done it before, but I finally managed to get our containers running, so you can see a "Hello World" message in them.

I got help from ChatGPT because Docker is a well-documented tool, and many people use it, which makes ChatGPT super helpful for solving problems!

Day 3 - 24/09/11 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, I realized I hadn’t added a .gitignore to our files, which caused a lot of unnecessary data to be sent to our repository.
So, I started deleting the files that shouldn’t be there, and while I was working, the computer shut down due to low battery.
I finished the changes the day after.

Day 4 - 24/09/12 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned on "Day 3," I completed the .gitignore.

Day 5 - 24/09/24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, I spent my time in Figma. Figma is a design program that can be used to design websites, for example.
I’ve used Figma before, so it didn’t take long to get back into it.

I created a landing page for the frontend, "Burger Orderer," as well as an "Order Page" where you can build your burger.

Today, I didn’t feel like there were any issues, and everything went pretty smoothly!

Tomorrow, the plan is to continue with Figma and also create views for smaller devices like mobile phones and iPads.

Day 6 - 24/09/25 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, I focused on setting up the frontend components for our project "Hamburger Orderer" using React and Tailwind CSS.

I worked on implementing the Home Page and Order Page based on the designs I created in Figma. 
After setting up the basic layout, I also integrated Tailwind CSS into the project to ensure a responsive and modern design.
It took some time to properly configure the Webpack setup, but after fixing missing dependencies and ensuring proper CSS handling, everything worked as expected.

I also updated our Trello board with detailed checklists for the upcoming features i want to add.

i didnt use any git commands today except git pull,  git add and git commit.

Day 6.5: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a little break i came back to the project to add all of the pages, thats when i remebered that i needed a router in my website so that i can jump inbetween my order and home page
So i added react-router-dom to the project and fixed a little bit with the code so that it worked, nothing hard.

this time i used the commands: Git Branch, Git commit and git push.

next time: since i am waiting for the backend to start working i am planning to further refine the pages i have made by adding features and styling.


Day 7 - 24/09/26 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today i feel like i have done a lot. I have fixed the css on the Home-Page and also added functionality to the Order-Page. Though, i have not really followed my Figma design since i found it to be ugly
and i got access to more assets that made me get more inspiration.

Today i learnt alot about the React library for javascript. I have used useState, useEffect, useReducer. Before i didnt know what a reducer was but today i found out that its pretty neat, and nice to use.
The way i learnt everything for today was through chatGPT. I think that chatgpt comes in really handy and it helps alot with productivity. Since i have already studied Web-Development I kind of know how
to do everything i need to i can use chatGPT as a tool to get it done faster, and if i get stuck i know what i can tell it to nudge it in the right path.

I had some problems with my Cart and the Items inside of it. I created 3 fake json files with data to simulate fetching from the server. There i had IDs on all of the items 
and when i added items it saw some of them as the same thing. 
example:

added 1 hamburger patty

cart[
{
  {id: 1, name: "beef patty"}

then adding 1 fries since it also has the ID of 1 in its json file it just adds one more beef patty.

this i had to fix by myself since chatgpt couldnt help and it went good, i slowly worked my way through the code and found the problem, so now i am checking the names instead of IDs. 
Im also thinking of Changing the way the cart works by creating a object that looks something like this

cart{
  hamburger: [{}]
  drinks: [{}]
  extras: [{}]  

this way i can instead put the items in categories which will also fix my problem (I think)

The git commands i used today was: Git Branch, Git commit -m "", git add ., and git merge "branchname"

Tomorrow i want to keep working on the Order-Page since i am done with the Home-Page.
the first thing i want to work on is the cart idea i had.
then i also want to make the page responsive for mobile and tablet devices. 


day 7.5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I rembered that i hadnt ran the containers for a while and i wanted to see if it would still work, so i decided to download docker on my home computer. I had some struggles since i had to enable
cpu virtulization in my BIOS and then when i tried to run "docker compose up" it still wouldnt work, but when i tried it on my shcool laptop it did work. I have no idea why this happend 
and i do not plan on fixing it in the future.



day 8 30/09/24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today i redid the kitchenview folder and removed react, other libraries, and unnecessary dependencies, this is so that we will have a clean directory and it will
be as simple as possible to code and create the KitchenView.



day 9 01/10/24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today i created documentation for my sourcecode with the help of JSDocs, i created JSDocs comments on my files and React components so that i can run a automized documentation generation program
I had some problems with dependencies and such but it was pretty easy to fix. I also moved my file out of OneDrive since that caused some trouble too.

I used Git Fetch Git Pull Git Push Git Merge Git Branch Git Checkout

day 10 03/10/24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today i got to fixing the order page. I changed the layout a little bit and also fixed the cart logic so that it works better. 
As i previously said in this logbook i changed the state to this

cart{
  hamburger: [{}]
  drinks: [{}]
  extras: [{}]  

which helped me create more readable code and it was also more easy to handle.

It is getting harder and harder every day to navigate in the code since its only getting larger which might be a problem in the future if someone wants to join. 
I might have to go and refactor some code also.

the thing on tomorrows agenda is fixing the css so that it looks better. Then i also want to fix the Json structure for checkout so that i can send the order to our server.

Today i used: I used Git Fetch Git Pull Git Push Git Merge Git Branch Git Checkout


day 11 10/10/24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today i have fixed some bugs in my code, they were located in my cart component, the extra items werent handled correctly.
It is now fixed.

I also added a checkout button which sends the order to the server, the server does not yet have the functionallity to add an order to the database yet.

the next step is to add some tests to the code. Im going to try and see if there already is a react testing library i can use for this purpose.

Otherwise the day want good, i didnt really have any problems.

I used Git Merge, Git Checkout, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push
