## Summary of why we use Configuration Management

Configuration Management is a way to keep track of all the changes made to a system,
like software or hardware, so everything stays organized and works correctly.
It helps make sure that when updates or changes happen, nothing breaks, 
and everything is consistent. It’s like having a system to manage different versions and changes, 
so you always know what’s going on and can fix problems easily.

## Summary of the Git workflow

### connect so some sort of remote versionmanagement service like:

github  
bitbucket  
gitlab  

### create a remote repository

on github website

### clone the project

git clone (link to remote repo)

### make your own branch

git branch (branch name of choice)

### start coding
write code

### merge the branch

git checkout main
git marge (branch name)

### stage the changes

git add (files)

### commit the changes

git commit -m "your commit message"

### push the changes to the remote repo

# Experience of using Git and Github

## what went well?

almost everything went well. we didnt have a lot of times where we had problems. It was good to use and pretty easy to learn the basics of.

## what went less good?

we had a couple of merge errors here and there when we tried to work on the same files.
It was a learning experience though since we had to solve the conflicts of the merge error togehter

### how we solved and what we didnt solve.

most of the problems we had was just a quick google search away from solving and we didnt find anything that we couldnt solve.
